We Belarusians are peaceful people,
We're the saints of our native land,
We're in the old, free land.
We're in a working, free land.

Hail, our land's bright name,
Glory to the people's brotherly union!
Our beloved mother Radzima,
Eternally alive and vitality, Belarus!

Together with our brothers and sisters.
We lambasted our native ferry,
We fought for our will, fought for our share.
We fought for our will, fought for our share!

Hail, our land's bright name,
Glory to the people's brotherly union!
Our beloved mother Radzima,
Eternally alive and vitality, Belarus!

Friendship of the people is the strength of the people - the soul of the people.
Our cherished, sunny path.
We proudly look up to the clear heights,
The fair play is possible - the joyful play!

Hail, our land's bright name,
Glory to the people's brotherly union!
Our beloved mother Radzima,
Eternally alive and vitality, Belarus!
